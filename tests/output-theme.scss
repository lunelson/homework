  TODO: theme spec v3

  1.contrast-color should work in terms of base-lite & base-dark, or fg and bg colors of the theme
  2.theme processing should build color names within the ui key expecting either a map or map of maps or list of maps
  3.theme-color names must be built up progressively, e.g. theme-ui-link-color or theme-ui-hover-color

  STANDARD KEYS: fg bg bd ol fill stroke
  .fg-theme -- use theme FG color as FG
  .fg-theme-bg -- use theme BG color as FG

  DYNAMIC KEYS: any non-standard key names, [ui], e.g. primary, secondary
  .bg-theme-[ui]-link -- use theme [ui] link color as BG
  .bg-theme-[ui] -- use dynamic state colors on background
  .bd-theme-ui -- use dynamic state colors on border
  .fg-contrast -- !! should dynamically change, as bg UI colors change with state

  TYPICAL base spec of a theme is as follows:

  $themes: (
    lite: (
      fg: base-black,
      bg: base-white,
      ui: (
        link: baz,
        hover: bar,
      ),
    ),
    dark: (
      fg: base-white,
      bg: base-black,
      ui: (
        link: fiz,
        hover: foo,
      ),
    ),
  );
